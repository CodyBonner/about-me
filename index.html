      <p id = "detailOne"><strong> First Family Graduate</strong> As boring as it may sound, I was actually the first in my entire family to not only attent but to graduate college. While this may not sound too exciting for some this was a huge accomplishment in my life as it was my way of not sticking to the mold of the family and just working without education. I grew up loving computers and video games so I combined the best of both worlds and went to school for Game Design Simulation and Development. Not only learning the skills and tools to make a pretty game scenary but also learning the underside of the hood of game making in how to make the game functional as well. And this will always be something I am proud to admit to everyone.

        <p><strong> Job Experience</strong> My job experience may seem conventional to some but to me my job experience molded me into the person I am today. My first ever job was with none other than my local Walmart, exciting right, while i admit it wasn't the best or most rewarding job I've ever had, it did teach me something. Not all jobs will work out for you, well what do I mean? When I got my first job, i was also attending my second year of college, I thought since i had loads of free time from year one i'd probably have similar results in year two. However I did not foresee that working would eat up not only my free time but my study time as well and so school became harder and i reluctantly decided to part ways with walmart. However I was later able to find a similar job where I was able to manage my school and work life balance and not only continue my education but complete it as well.

          Following school however, I was lucky enough to land a contract job with a fabulous company known as CAE USA. There while under the leadership and guidance of my project manager, I worked on 3D assets that would later be utilized for military flight simulations. Following that contract I landed a job as a shift manager where i held that position till I eventually moved up through the ranks to assistant manager and to finally a general manager.

        <p><strong> My Goals </strong> My goals on a personal level aren't something grand or exciting, it's something simple. I want a fullfilling life instead of just sitting around home all day. I want the chance to experience things I've never seen before and create memories that I can pass along to my future kids.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now my work goals are little bit different. I want what I do to have meaning. I don't want to get lost in the never ending cycle of replaceable bodies. I want there to be a sort of legacy left behind. It doesn't have to be national level or world level. However what I want is for my contribution to mean something. Whether that's creating the next outstanding webpage that everyone uses or whether it's creating a simple plugin that helps with everyones day to day but something that everyone knows.
