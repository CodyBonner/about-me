      <p id = "detailOne"><strong> First Family Graduate</strong> As boring as it may sound, I was actually the first in my entire family to not only attent but to graduate college. While this may not sound too exciting for some this was a huge accomplishment in my life as it was my way of not sticking to the mold of the family and just working without education. I grew up loving computers and video games so I combined the best of both worlds and went to school for Game Design Simulation and Development. Not only learning the skills and tools to make a pretty game scenary but also learning the underside of the hood of game making in how to make the game functional as well. And this will always be something I am proud to admit to everyone.</p>
